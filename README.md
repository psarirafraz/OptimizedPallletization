This calculator finds the best number of cartons that fit on a pallet. It also shows the image of the pallet and its cartons from above. I wrote the wole calculator in HTML, Javascript, and three.js. All of needed code to add to your website is in OptimizedPallletization/OptimizedPallletization/Default.aspx between <asp:Content> tag. The code is ready to run and pull from this repos. I have done more on this project like better quality view, more options and extra side view, but it's not in this project. If you want more like this project hit me at parsasarirafraz@gmail.com
